        <h2>About University</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to University, a comprehensive education institution dedicated to providing quality education and
            supporting the academic journey of students, faculty, staff, and administrators. At University, we strive to
            create an inclusive and vibrant learning environment that fosters growth, knowledge, and collaboration.
        </p>

            As an admin, you play a crucial role in managing the university's operations. You have the power to create,
            update, and delete users across various roles, such as admin, teacher, student, and staff. Additionally, you
            have full control over courses, groups, students, staff, teachers, admins, faculties, departments,
            classrooms, and timetables, allowing you to streamline administrative tasks and ensure smooth operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Teachers at University are dedicated educators who shape the academic experience. They have the ability to
            view and manage their own timetables, as well as the timetables of other teachers and specific groups. They
            can also update the timetables of individual students and make group assignments for their courses. With
            access to department and faculty information, as well as details about groups, students, and staff, teachers
            can effectively plan and deliver high-quality education.
        </p>
        <p>
            Students at University are at the heart of our institution. They have access to their personal timetables,
            allowing them to stay organized and keep track of their classes. They can also view the timetables of their
            groups, specific groups, and all groups, ensuring they have the information they need for a successful
            academic journey. Students can explore department and faculty details, as well as connect with fellow
            students in their own group, fostering a sense of community and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Staff members at University provide invaluable support to the entire academic community. They have access to
            timetables of teachers, specific groups, and all groups, enabling them to assist in scheduling and
            coordination. With comprehensive access to department, faculty, and staff information, as well as details
            about groups and students, staff members can contribute to the smooth functioning of the university.
        </p>
        <p>
            At University, we are committed to creating an environment where everyone can thrive academically and
            personally. Through the collaboration of admins, teachers, students, and staff, we strive to provide a
